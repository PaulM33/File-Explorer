# File-Explorer
A simple C# program (with a xaml GUI interface). The program is meant to emulate a simple windows file explorer.

Getting Started
================
The user selects a folder using the browse button, and the program will simply give some information about the selected folder. 
The left side of the GUI will display file and folder names in a tree format.
The right side of the GUI will display a number of information based on user selections, including:
  -Number of files and folders
  -Number of selected files and folders (selected from the tree display)
  -Total size of files.
